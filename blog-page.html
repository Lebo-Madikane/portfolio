                <p>Why do you need to learn the shell? In the world of computers, the shell is like a crucial doorway to how operating systems really work. It's also called
                the command line interface (CLI), where users control their computers using text-based commands. Even though we see a
                lot of fancy graphical interfaces (GUIs) in modern computing, the command line is still super important for both
                beginners and experts.</p><br>
                <p>Learning the command line is like learning the language of computers. It gives you a lot of power to do things quickly
                and efficiently, like managing software and controlling how your system operates. In today's tech world, being good at
                using the command line is a really valuable skill because it's used for things like automation and remote control. </p>
                <p>There are many reasons to learn about the shell:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The shell makes your tasks less boring. In computers, you often have to do the same things over and over, especially
                    with lots of files. Learning the shell lets you teach your computer to do those repetitive tasks automatically.</li>
                    <li>The shell makes your tasks less likely to have mistakes. When people do the same thing many times, they often make
                    errors. But your computer can repeat the same task many times without making any mistakes.</li>
                    <li>The shell makes your work easier to repeat. When you do your work using the command-line (instead of a Graphic User Interface),
                    your computer remembers every step you took(history). This means you can easily do the same work again when needed. It also lets
                    you clearly explain(comment) what you did, so others can check or do the same thing with new information.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>In this guide, we explore why learning about the command line is important. We'll cover the basics, practical uses, and
                the many benefits it offers to those who take the time to learn its ins and outs.</p>

            <article>
                <p>A shell is a computer program that presents a command line interface (CLI) which allows you to control your computer
                using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard
                combination.</p><br>
                <p>If you have a Mac or Linux computer, you can use a program called Terminal to access the shell. It's already on your
                computer. But if you're using Windows, you have to download a separate program to access the shell.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Before delving into navigating the shell, let's first examine the type of file system organization that the shell
                employs.</p><br>
                <p><span><strong>FILE SYSTEM TREE = MAZE</strong></span><br>The shell organizes folders and files in a tree-like structure, with directories(folders) containing subfolders and files. Think
                of it like standing in a maze where each directory represents a different location. At any moment, you're in one
                specific directory, known as the working directory. Inside this directory, you'll find files and pathways. To find out
                the name of the current working directory, simply use the 'pwd' command.</p><br>
                <p>To print the name of the working directory, we use the <strong>pwd</strong> command:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">pwd</span><br>/Users/lebomadikane</code><br>
                <p>To list the files and directories of the working directory, we use the <strong>ls</strong> command:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">ls</span><br>Applications Downloads Pictures<br>Desktop Library Public
                Documents Movies</code><br>
                <p>To change to a different directory within the maze, we utilize the <strong>cd</strong> command followed by the pathname of the desired
                directory:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">cd /usr/bin</span><br>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro bin]$</code><br>
                <p>Pathnames can be specified in two different ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>Absolute Pathname</strong> starts from the root (/) directory and then follows the tree, branch by branch, until it reaches
                    the desired directory or file.
                    </li>
                    <li>A <strong>Relative Pathname</strong> starts from the working directory and navigates to its destination. It can also utilize special
                    notations to represent relative positions in the maze. </li>
                </ul>

            <article>
                <p>Now that we've mastered navigating the shell file system—like printing the working directory and switching between
                directories—it's time to delve into exploring the shell file system further.</p>
                <p>Below are some of the basic commands to help us look around the shell:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ls</strong> - list files and directories (as discussed before)</li>
                    <li><strong>less</strong> - view text files</li>
                    <li><strong>file</strong> - classify a file's content</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>less</strong> - A program that lets us view text files:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">less text_file</span></code><br>
                <p><strong>file</strong> - A program that will examine a file and tell us what kind of file it is and data a file contains:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">file filename</span></code>

            <header>Manipulating Files</header>
            <article>
                <p>In this lesson, we'll cover the following commands:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>cp</strong> - copy files and directories</li>
                    <li><strong>mv</strong> - move or rename files and directories</li>
                    <li><strong>rm</strong> - remove/delete files and directories</li>
                    <li><strong>mkdir</strong> - create a directory</li>
                    <li><strong>touch</strong> - create a file</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p>The <strong>cp</strong> command copies files and directories:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">cp file1 file2</span></code>
                <p>The code above copies the content of file1 into file2. If file2 doesn't exist, it's created. Otherwise, file2 is
                silently overwritten with the contents of file1.</p><br>
                <p>The <strong>mv</strong> command moves and renames files and directories. To rename a file, it is used like this:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">mv filename new-filename</span></code><br>
                <p>To move files (and/or directories) to a different directory:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">mv filename directory</span></code><br>
                <p>The <strong>rm</strong> command removes/deletes files and directories:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">rm file1 file2</span></code><br>
                <p>To remove directories we have to use the flag(or option) <strong>-r</strong>:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">rm -r directory-name1 directory-name2</span></code><br>
                <p>The <strong>mkdir</strong> command is used to create directories:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">mkdir directory-name</span></code><br>
                <p>The <strong>touch</strong> command is used to create files:</p>
                <code>[lebomadikane@lebo-MacBook-Pro]$ <span class="command">touch filename</span></code>

            <article>
                <p>We've done a lot of work with existing files, but what if we want to write our own files? There are many reasons we
                    might want to do this, or to edit an existing file. To add text to files, we'll use a text editor.</p>
                <p>Text editors are like digital notebooks where you can write and modify text. They are essential in shell because they
                    facilitate working with text files. Some common ones include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vim</li>
                    <li>Emacs</li>
                    <li>Nano</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>They have helpful tools like finding words and making text look colorful to help you work better.</p>

            <article>
                <p>One great advantage of the command line is the ability to write scripts. Scripts enable you to save a list of commands in a single file for future
                execution and combine multiple commands together. While writing scripts may require some initial time investment, it can
                save you a lot of time in the long run, especially when you need to run them repeatedly.</p><br>
                <p>To ensure your file functions as a bash script, here are some important steps to follow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Include the "Shebang" line as the opening line of your file: #!/bin/bash.</li>
                    <li>Grant execution permissions to your file using the chmod command.</li>
                    <li>Optionally, you can use the .sh extension for your bash script file.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>These steps help ensure that your file behaves as a bash script and can be executed properly.</p>
